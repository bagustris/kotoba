// Orchestrates adaptive distractor generation: the only file in this module
// that assembles the candidate pool, touches ProgressManager, and invokes a
// strategy (mirroring how QuestionSelector is the only file in the
// question-selection module that touches ProgressManager). Feature
// extraction is delegated to SimilarityFeatures, scoring to whichever
// strategy is configured in DistractorConfig (DistractorGenerator never
// depends on a specific strategy implementation, only on the
// DistractorStrategy contract).
//
// Flow: DistractorGenerator.generate(question, itemList)
//         -> build candidate pool (every other item's readings, excluding
//            the correct answer), tagging each candidate with how many
//            times this learner has actually picked that reading wrong for
//            this question before (ProgressManager.getConfusions)
//         -> SimilarityFeatures.compute(question, candidate) per candidate
//         -> config.strategy.score(features, config)
//         -> rank candidates
//         -> take the highest-scoring, skipping duplicate reading strings
//         -> return up to config.selection.distractorCount reading strings
//
// Answer-order shuffling stays the caller's responsibility (app.js), same
// as before — this module only decides *which* distractors to use.

  // data's `frequencyRank` (see data/words/<context>.json); `grade` has no
  // kotoba equivalent and is left undefined — SimilarityFeatures treats that
  // as "unavailable" and scores it 0 rather than throwing. `confusions` is
